**Goals**: 
- Review DP

**Resources**:
- [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/dynamic_programming/divide-and-conquer-dp.html)
- [topcoder DP](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

**Time**: 1 hour

**Journal**

1. First started reading cp-algorithms.
2. Didn't felt confident understanding 1.
3. Started reading topcoder article.
4. DAmn, I was raw at first but slowly got a bit of pace.
5. Had some problems creating topcoder account
6. went to cs97si Stanford CP course, picked DP lecture
7. Read 1D DP part

**Conclusions**

Didn't made much progress, but as a warm up I feel okay. Next training session I will solve a couple of DP problems.
