 *  [Maybe this is flawed, but it got AC. Nevertheless, here's my reasoning.]
 *  - Let's define:
 *      1. Even state: 2 piles have an even amount of rocks.
 *      2. Odd state: not even state.
 *  - If a player is on an even state, the second player can always force him to
 * be on even states.
 *  - So, since the end state has trivially an even state, then whoever
 * starts on an uneven state can force the second player to lose by keeping him
 * on even states.
