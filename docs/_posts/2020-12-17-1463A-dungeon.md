Note that the total health of enemies has to be a multiple of 9 (6 + 3), if
you want to pass the dungeon beautifully.

In such case, the total amount of enhance shots done will be $x =
\frac{s}{9}$, where $s$ denotes the total health of enemies.

Note that the actual amount of enhanced shots possible is bounded by the
minimum health of all monsters (every enhanced shot forces us to reduce all
monster's health by 1). So, if $x \leq \min(a, b, c)$, there's always a way
to reduce the excess health with normal shots (given our previous assumption
that $s$ is a multiple of $9$).
