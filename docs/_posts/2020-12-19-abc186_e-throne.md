Let the throne lie at position $0$ and Takahashi at position $S$. We want to
find:

$$ s + xk \equiv 0 \mod n $$

Furthermore, to simplify the problem, let $y = s + xk$, the position where
Takahashi first meets the Throne (if we were to count distance rather than
displacement). Assume that such a value exists.

We can say a couple of things about $y$.
1. $y$ will be at the Throne's position (after some number of laps around the
circle), or: $$y \equiv 0 \mod n$$
2. $y$ is reachable by some number of $k$-displacements: $$y - s \equiv 0
\mod k$$

If we arrange 2. to be $y \equiv s \mod k$ then we have two modular
congruencies that we can solve using the chinese remainder theorem.

Having solved the modular equations, the only thing left to do is to solve
for $x$ in the aforementioned equivalence: $y=s+xk$.
