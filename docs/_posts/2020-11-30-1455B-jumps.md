title: 1455B - Jumps

memory_complexity: O(1)
time_complexity: O(\log{n})

Note that we have to make at least $n$ jumps to reach $x$ (always jumping
forward), where $n$ is:

$$ n = argmin_n(f(n)- x >= 0) $$

Where $f(n) = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}$. Intuitively, the answer shouldn't
be much bigger than that.

Furthermore, we know that $0 <= f(n) - x < n$ (because of the $argmin$
constraints). We have to select a subset of our forward steps and turn them
into backward steps, or try increasing $n$.

We can think of reversing a step $k$ as decreasing $f(n)$ by $k + 1$. For our
range of $[1, n]$, we would have options $[2, n + 1]$.

The problem splits in three cases:
1. $f(n) - x = 0$: $n$ is the answer.
2. $2 <= f(n) - x < n$: We can reverse the step $f(n) - x - 1$. $n$ is the
answer.
3. $f(n) - x = 1$: There's no way to reverse any step from $[1, n]$ to get to
$x$, but we can just take the $n + 1$ step backward. $n + 1$ is the answer.
