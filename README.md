# Algorithms and Competitive Programming

This repository will track my progress in competitive programming.

I've decided that I will train approximately 15 hours a week, not with the ultimate aim of actually competing, but rather just for the sake of having fun and learning :^). 
I will try to keep track of every training session, describing a brief summary in the `journal/` folder.
